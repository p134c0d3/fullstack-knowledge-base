# TypeScript Basic Exercises

I find TypeScript's errors rather intuitive as it tells me **EXACTLY**  what is wrong with my code, and in a sense directs me towards the solution. It definitely takes some getting used to having to remember to look at the errors to see what they mean, which often happens **AFTER** I've troubleshoot the code on my own for a good minute or two. Overall these exercises were pretty straightforward and intuitive, and I received some good hands-on practice in TypeScript syntax in Classes, Methods, Functions, Objects, and Data Types.
