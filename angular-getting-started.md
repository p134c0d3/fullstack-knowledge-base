# Angular: Getting Started

What were the "internal reasons" that caused Angular 3 to be skipped?

Angular 2 and higher are just referred to as "Angular".

I learned how to import Bootstrap and other styles using npm and linking those into my Angular project.

I learned how to add modules into my application, and how to edit the AppComponent class in the app.component.ts file in order to use that in my app.component.html file.
